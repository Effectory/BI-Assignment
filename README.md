# BI-Assignment

## Case: Survey dashboard

For this BI assessment, we want you to create a dashboard, using the datafile provided.
We recommend you to try to restrict the amount of time you spend on this case, preferably within a day. 
-	Load the data in a normalized SQL database. (Please assume the solution should process multiple files with different sets of questions, modules and hierarchy levels)
-	Create a query that calculates the aggregated data. Calculate for all the questions and modules, the average answer weight (where applicable) and answer distribution per node in the hierarchy. 
-	Create a dashboard where the averages are reported and you can drill through the hierarchy and answer distribution.

The goal of the assignment is to get an idea of your experience, creativity, and ability to learn, analyze and reason.<BR>
  
## Datafile

In the provided datafile you can find the raw data of the survey, the questionnaire and the content of the modules. A module is an average of different questions. You can find them on the module tab.<BR>

## Tech stack

It is recommended to stay close to Effectoryâ€™s tech stack. So we get a better understanding of how you fit within our current product portfolio. More specifically, we suggest you use the Microsoft BI stack/ Azure and Power BI.<BR>

## Expectations
Depending on your degree of experience, we would like to see some creative ideas integrated in your solution. This is entirely up to you, and you can choose anything you want to enrich your solution. Some examples include
  
-	Clean data.
-	ETL process.
-	Keep performance in mind.
-	Normalized data model.
-	A good looking dashboard with some nice features.
-	Think about what should be added next or in the future while working with a team.
  
This assignment can be quite some work, in the end we expect a sufficient, working solution. 
And that you can explain how you approached this assignment and why you made some decisions.
